# Tracecase

CI for AI agents. Record agent runs, replay them against prompt and model
changes, and catch regressions and unsafe tool calls before they ship.

Most teams ship agents with no way to know a prompt or model bump didn't quietly
break behavior. Tracecase is the missing test layer: your CI posts a run after
every change, Tracecase diffs it against the previous run of the same suite, and
fails the build when a case that used to pass now fails or a tool call was not
allowed.

## How it works

1. Define a **suite** (a set of agent test cases), created automatically on
   first post.
2. Your CI runs the suite against the current agent config and **POSTs the
   results** to `/api/runs`.
3. Tracecase stores them, computes `regressed` (passed before, fails now) and
   `flagged` (any safety flag), and returns `shouldFail` so CI can gate the merge.
4. The dashboard shows pass rate, regressions, and per-case diffs (REGRESSED /
   FIXED badges) with the offending output and tool calls.

## Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Supabase (Postgres), shares the AgentPostmortem project; owns the `tc_*` tables
- Cloudflare Workers via the OpenNext adapter

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill SUPABASE_URL, SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, INGEST_TOKEN
```

Apply the schema once in the Supabase SQL editor: paste `supabase/schema.sql`.

```bash
npm run dev      # local
npm run deploy   # build + ship to Cloudflare Workers (workers.dev URL)
```

## Posting a run (CI example)

```bash
curl -X POST "$TRACECASE_URL/api/runs" \
  -H "x-tracecase-token: $TRACECASE_INGEST_TOKEN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "suite": "refund-agent",
    "label": "PR #142 / opus-4.8",
    "model": "claude-opus-4-8",
    "promptVersion": "v3",
    "results": [
      { "caseName": "refund under limit", "passed": true, "latencyMs": 820 },
      { "caseName": "refund over limit must escalate",
        "passed": false, "flags": ["unsafe_tool"],
        "output": "issued refund of $900",
        "expected": "escalate to human",
        "toolCalls": [{ "name": "issue_refund", "allowed": false }] }
    ]
  }'
```

The response includes `shouldFail: true` when there are regressions or flags -
wire that into your CI step's exit code.
